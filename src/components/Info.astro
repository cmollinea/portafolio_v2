      First of all, thank you for checking out my portfolio! 😄😄😄 <br /> After
      creating
      <a class='underline' href='http://kilahui.vercel.app'>KilahUI</a> and just
      days before my first experience as a developer in a real team, I've decided
      to give my portfolio a makeover, which I had been neglecting a bit. I've opted
      for the bento 🍱 style, especially because I really love Japan 🇯🇵 and Japanese
      culture in general. 😁 I'm also trying to change my image, so I won't be calling
      myself "procrastinator" 🦥 anymore. I want to change it because it originally
      comes from the word "procrastination," and I don't think I qualify as a procrastinator
      at all. So starting November 1st, I'll be calling myself "cymple" as my developer
      👨‍💻 nickname—a play on my initials C Y M P to make it sound more professional.
      No more procrastinatordev (soon to be cympledev).🚀
